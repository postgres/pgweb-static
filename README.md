# PostgreSQL: Static Website Component Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the PostgreSQL Static Website Component Repository. This repository hosts fully static components of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), particularly large files. By keeping these assets separate, we ensure that the size of the code repository remains manageable.

## Purpose
This repository serves a fundamental purpose:

1. **Centralized Asset Storage**: It provides a centralized location for storing all static assets, promoting an organized structure.
2. **Efficient Access**: Developers and content creators can easily access these assets for website development and content creation.
3. **Version Control**: We maintain version control for all static assets, simplifying the process of tracking changes and updates.

## Folder Structure
Our repository follows a structured hierarchy to streamline asset management:

- **/about**: This section contains assets related to the [About](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) page.
  - **/casestudies**: Here, you can find various case studies conducted by the PostgreSQL team.
- **/community**: Assets in this folder pertain to Confluence and community-held events.
- **/developer**: This section stores technical documentation that can be utilized by PostgreSQL developers.
- **/documentation**: For different versions of PostgreSQL documentation.

## Getting Started
To access and utilize the static components, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository using the `git clone` command to obtain a local copy.
2. **Navigate to the Desired Folder**: Choose the specific folder you require (e.g., /developer) to access the assets you need.
3. **Download or Update**: Download the necessary asset or make updates if required.
4. **Commit and Push Changes**: If you make any changes, remember to commit and push them to maintain version control.
